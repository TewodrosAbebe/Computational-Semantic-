Semantic similarity measures are the ability to compare various terms, such as words and sentences. By comparing words that are conceptually related but not necessarily lexically related, semantic similarity metrics can be used to determine the degree of significance between the two sets of words. Different natural language processing applications use semantic similarity measures (NLP). The vagueness of words, the complexity of real languages, and other issues make calculating semantic similarity difficult. Despite their similarity in meaning, the words are not lexicographically interchangeable.
